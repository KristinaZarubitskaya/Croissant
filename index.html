    <p>
      There’s something mysterious– even alchemical— about the qualities that
      have to come together to yield the ideal croissant. To fit the bill, it
      should be buttery and tender, but never mushy or overly moist. It requires
      a delicate flakiness-to-slight-chewiness ratio, and the layers of
      all-butter puff pastry should be well differentiated, without falling
      apart into a crumby mess when you bite into them. The bake should be
      golden, but not overdone. In short, it’s an art– one that the French in
      particular are very proud of. But how did this love affair start? Keep
      reading for a brief but fascinating history of the croissant– and to learn
      how France came to embrace the crescent-shaped pastry as a de facto
      national emblem, then became the global standard-bearer for how it should
      be made. Oddly enough, and as you’ll learn shortly, the original pastry
      that inspired today’s typical butter croissants (croissants au beurre)
      bear only a moderate resemblance to the ones we gobble down today…
